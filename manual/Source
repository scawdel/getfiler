<chapter title="Introduction and Use" file="Use">

Since the demise of the <menu>Save Desktop</menu> option in the <cite>Task Manager</cite> menu under RISC&nbsp;OS Select, it is no longer possible to get a list of the Filer window positions. Even under earlier versions of RISC&nbsp;OS, saving this file just for the <command>*Filer_OpenDir</command> commands was a contrived thing to do. <cite>GetFiler</cite> is a solution.

Copy <cite>GetFiler</cite> out of the archive and run it in the usual way by double-clicking on the <file>!GetFiler</file> icon; <file>GetFiler</file> loads on to the icon bar in the normal way. Clicking <mouse>select</mouse> on its icon opens a save window allowing an Obey file containing <command>*Filer_OpenDir</command> commands for all of the open directory viewers to be saved.
